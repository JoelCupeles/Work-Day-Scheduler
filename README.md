# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This is a daily planner application that allows users to add and manage their daily schedule effectively. The application provides timeblocks for standard business hours and color codes each timeblock to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Users can enter events into each timeblock and save the text for each event in local storage, which persists even when the page is refreshed.

## Installation
No installation is required for this project.

## Usage
To use the application, simply click into the timeblock for the corresponding hour you want to add an event to. Type in your event and click the save button to save the text for that event in local storage. The text will persist even when you refresh the page.
